# About the project

In this project I built my own version of the game [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) using **Ruby**. The goal was to use **classes** and **methods** to set up the basic elements of the game. 

The specifications for this project can be found at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).
